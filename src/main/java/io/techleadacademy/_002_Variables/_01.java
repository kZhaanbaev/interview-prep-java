     * A variable in Java is a container that holds data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.
     * Each variable has a specific data type that determines the size and layout of the variableâ€™s memory:
     * - the range of values that can be stored
     * - the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
     *
     * To use a variable, you first need to declare it, specifying its data type and name.
     * Optionally, you can also initialize it with a value when you declare it.
     *
     * dataType variableName = value;
